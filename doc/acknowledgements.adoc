Thank you for this amazing experience, a lot of fun, I learned a lot. With all the groovy community, groovy and
grails developers and all people interested in the project, this journey has been an incredible experience.
Is hard put names of people that helped me this years, sure I forget someone.

Special thanks to *@glaforge*, *@marioggar* and *Ren√©*, they
spent time at the beginning of this project. Also thanks to @burtbeckwith, @graemerocher for grails help, only
good things to say about all groovy and grails teams.

Thank you http://greachconf.com/[Greach] and http://gr8conf.eu/[Gr8Conf] teams for let me talk about grooscript in gr8 conferences.
All that people that sent me emails, commented me something, asked me about the project. Don't stop it, I love your feedback.

Thank you @jetbrains for a IntelliJ IDEA open source license, the best groovy IDE.
