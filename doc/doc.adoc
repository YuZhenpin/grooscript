== Conversion

For convert groovy code to javascript, that groovy code is compiled. Then javascript code is generated
visiting generated AST tree. You can try link:conversions.html[online] conversions at grooscript site.

You usually will convert files with groovy code to a destination folder or js file. To be dynamic and automatize
conversion process I strongly recommend to use https://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript-gradle-plugin[grooscript gradle plugin].
You can activate a daemon to automatically convert groovy code when files are modified.

=== Options

To help in conversion process, you can set some conversion options. To set conversion options:

[source,groovy]
--
//Set a conversion property
GrooScript.setConversionProperty('recursive', true)
GrooScript.setConversionProperty('customization', {
    ast(CompileStatic)
})
//Applied to next conversions
--
