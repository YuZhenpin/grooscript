Be aware javascript isn't Java or Groovy, lot of differences between them. The main idea of this project is use
Groovy strengths in the browser, not create a full conversion. I'm looking for use groovy code in the server and the client,
work in a single environment, use groovy and java tools and IDE's.

Grooscript is a library that converts your groovy code to javascript. I've tried that converted code doesn't contains
strange code or magical things. So you can use and follow that converted javascript code. This code needs `*grooscript.js*`
or `*grooscript.min.js*` to run in a javascript environment.

The typical flow is:

- Create awesome groovy or java code.
- Test it with https://code.google.com/p/spock/[Spock] :)
- Converts code to javascript.
- Add that converted files to your html or js project.
- Then, work in your groovy code and use javascript when you want to.

Grooscript offer some tools to help you, a https://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript-gradle-plugin[gradle]
