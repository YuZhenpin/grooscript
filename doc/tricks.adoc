- Keep your groovy code tested, sometimes your converted code doesn't work because groovy code fails.
- Don't use grooscript to create a big project, just introduce it in your projects.
- If you use @GsNative, keep that code in isolated classes, that can be easy to mock them.
- Don't abuse @GsNative, is code untested. Better write it in javascript and keep that code tested.
- Grooscript doesn't support all groovy and java, use link:conversions.html[online] convert before use it, to check support.
- You can activate `debug` console info in javascript with `gs.consoleInfo = true;`.
- Remember import `grooscript-html-builder.js` if you use HtmlBuilder.
- Use grooscript gradle plugin daemon task to do groovy changes, and see immediately in your browser.
- You can test dom manipulation with http://jsoup.org/[jsoup].
- Try develop functional, don't abuse this or variables from other contexts.
- Curry functions to inject variables better than expect to be available after callbacks hell.
